# Content Service - Resource Upload API

## Overview

The `content-service` is a focused microservice for **educational resource uploading**. It provides a single, robust endpoint for teachers and administrators to upload educational resources (videos, documents, quizzes, etc.) with proper metadata management and storage integration.

---

### Core Functionality

**üéØ Resource Upload:** Single `POST /resources` endpoint for uploading educational content
**üîó Concept Linking:** Links uploaded resources to existing concepts via Neo4j relationships  
**üë§ User Tracking:** Tracks which user uploaded each resource via API Gateway authentication
**üìÅ File Management:** Generates presigned URLs for secure file uploads to cloud storage
**üè∑Ô∏è Metadata Management:** Stores comprehensive resource metadata (tags, grade level, pricing, etc.)

---

### Technology Stack

* **Language/Framework:** [e.g., Node.js with NestJS]
* **Databases:**
    ***Graph (Primary Database):** Neo4j [cite: 1149]
* **File Storage:** AWS S3 (or compatible equivalent)
* **Containerization:** Docker

## Docker Deployment

### Building the Docker Image

The service includes a multi-stage Dockerfile optimized for production:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t content-service:latest .
```

### Local Development with Docker Compose

For local development with Neo4j database:

```bash
# Start all services (content-service + Neo4j)
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f content-service

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

The development setup includes:
- Content Service on `http://localhost:3000`
- Neo4j Browser on `http://localhost:7474` (username: `neo4j`, password: `password`)

### Production Deployment

For production deployment:

```bash
# Build for production
docker build -t content-service:latest .

# Run with production compose file
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables for production:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
NEO4J_URI=bolt://your-neo4j-host:7687
NEO4J_USERNAME=your-username
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-password
```

### AWS ECR Deployment

The service is configured for automatic deployment to AWS ECR via GitHub Actions:

1. Push to `main` branch triggers the workflow
2. Docker image is built and tagged with commit SHA
3. Image is pushed to ECR repository: `ecs-multi-app-dev-content-service`
4. Both versioned (`<commit-sha>`) and `latest` tags are created

### Health Check

The Docker image includes a built-in health check that monitors the `/health` endpoint:

```bash
# Manual health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```
