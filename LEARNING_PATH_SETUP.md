# Learning Path Schema - Summary

## âœ… Successfully Added to Neo4j Database

Date: October 16, 2025

### What Was Added

#### Node Types (3)
1. **User** - Represents users in the system
2. **LearningPath** - Personalized learning paths for users
3. **LearningPathStep** - Individual steps within a learning path

#### Relationships (2)
1. **HAS_LEARNING_PATH** - `(User)-[:HAS_LEARNING_PATH]->(LearningPath)`
2. **HAS_STEP** - `(LearningPath)-[:HAS_STEP]->(LearningPathStep)`

#### Constraints (3)
- `User.id` - UNIQUE
- `LearningPath.id` - UNIQUE  
- `LearningPathStep.id` - UNIQUE

#### Indexes (6)
- `User.id`
- `LearningPath.id`
- `LearningPath.status` - For filtering by processing/completed status
- `LearningPath.difficultyLevel` - For filtering by difficulty
- `LearningPathStep.id`
- `LearningPathStep.stepNumber` - For ordering steps

### Files Created/Updated

1. **PopulatingDB/add-learning-path-schema.js** - Standalone script to add schema
2. **PopulatingDB/populate-neo4j.js** - Updated to include Learning Path schema
3. **PopulatingDB/LEARNING_PATH_SCHEMA.md** - Complete documentation

### How to Use

#### Add schema only (preserves data):
```bash
node PopulatingDB/add-learning-path-schema.js
```

#### Full database repopulation:
```bash
node PopulatingDB/populate-neo4j.js
```

### Next Steps

The Learning Path feature is now ready to use with:
- Fixed Cypher queries in `learning-path.service.ts`
- Proper indexes for performance
- Unique constraints for data integrity

### Testing

You can now test the Learning Path endpoints:
- POST `/learning-path/request` - Request a new learning path
- GET `/learning-path` - Get user's learning path
- POST `/learning-path` - Create a learning path directly

All queries should now work without the "Write query failed" error.
